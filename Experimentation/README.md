## File Descriptions:

1. [premium_insurance_prediction_Siri.ipynb](https://github.com/Sirilukkan/ml-project-premium-prediction/blob/main/Experimentation/premium_insurance_prediction_Siri.ipynb)

   This notebook contains the complete process of data cleaning, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, machine learning model building, evaluation, and error analysis for the entire dataset (`premiums.xlsx`, available in the data folder).

2. [premium_insurance_prediction_Siri_rest.ipynb](https://github.com/Sirilukkan/ml-project-premium-prediction/blob/main/Experimentation/premium_insurance_prediction_Siri_rest.ipynb)

   This notebook is a variation of the first file, focused solely on data for individuals aged > 25.

3. [premium_insurance_prediction_Siri_young.ipynb](https://github.com/Sirilukkan/ml-project-premium-prediction/blob/main/Experimentation/premium_insurance_prediction_Siri_young.ipynb)

   This notebook applies the same process as the first file but is tailored for individuals aged â‰¤ 25.

From files 2 and 3, two separate models for young individuals and the rest were built to improve accuracy. Additionally, a new feature was added to the dataset (`premium_young_with_gr.xlsx`) to further enhance the model. The corresponding models were built in the following notebooks:
